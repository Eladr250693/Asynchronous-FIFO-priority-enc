# Asynchronous-FIFO

#About the project
This project is mainly focus on build an asynchronous fifo in verilog and make further optimization.
More importantily, this project is used as github 101 to let me familar with github.

#What is FIFO?
FIFO means first in first out.

Why FIFO is important?
FIFOs are often used to safely pass data from one clock domain to another asynchronous clock domain.
